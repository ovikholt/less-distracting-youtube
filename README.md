Chrome extension that hides the "related videos" sidebar (until you click to show it).

To convert the .styl to .css and the .coffee files to .js files:

```
npm install -g cake
cake watch
```

Installation:

    git clone git://github.com/ovikholt/less-distracting-youtube
    Open chrome://extensions in your Chrome browser.
    "Developer mode" checkbox must be checked.
    Click `Load unpacked extension...`.
    Navigate to the cloned directory and press OK.
    Open a Youtube video! :)

Suggestions appreciated.
