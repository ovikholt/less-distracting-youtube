Chrome extension that hides the "related videos" sidebar (until you click to show it).

To convert the .styl to .css and the .coffee files to .js files:

```
npm install -g cake
cake watch
```

Installation:

    git clone git://github.com/ovikholt/less-distracting-youtube
    Open chrome://extensions
    Click `Load unpacked extension...`
    Navigate to the cloned directory

Suggestions appreciated.
